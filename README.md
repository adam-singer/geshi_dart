Dart Syntax Highlighter for GeSHi
=================================


Syntax highlighter for dart in geshi. Rosetta code uses this highlighter, maybe on future releases a dart.php could be included. [BenBE](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/geshi-doc.html#feedback) is the maintainer of the project and pushes releases that rosettacode.org uses. 

[dart.php](/geshi/dart.php)
--------

Building the sample test.php with embedded dart code generates test.html: 

    ./buildTest.sh
